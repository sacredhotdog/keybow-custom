### Custom Keybow Configuration

**NB!** This repository ignores everything expect for:
* The `snippets/` folder,
* The custom key layout files in the `layouts/` folder (which need to be prefixed with `lco-`),
* `keys.lua`, which sets up the custom layout mapping,
* And this readme

That said, the assumption is that all the files required for the Keybow SD card are present, allowing for easier 
incorporation of upstream firmware changes from [https://github.com/pimoroni/keybow-firmware/releases](https://github.com/pimoroni/keybow-firmware/releases).
